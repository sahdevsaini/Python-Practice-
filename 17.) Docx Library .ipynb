      "The project is ‘Faster and Better results from packaging’ and in this project our focus is that we will provide a faster service and  better result from our Packaging . Our task is that how we can reduce response time while we creating a trip from source to destination our product taking more time to load results given by the respective airline API’s and hotel API’s. So first we have to know the region why our product taking more time to load data either our API or product  is responsible for it or API of respective airlines or Hotels is resposible for it. So we did a analysis on it for knowing the region that what is the region why this problem occuring with our product and create a report and for better looking of UI we have to introduce a process bar instead of cloud loading symbol which is looking better as compare to loading symbole.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am working on a project “ Faster and Better results from Packaging” and objective is to reduce response time by displaying the data in different format later UI shows result after collecting data from all the respective airline API and if some API taking more time then remaining API till waiting to respond to solve this problem we show data separtly instead of show showing complete data. As the API will display on screen by UI so there is no need wait for long time as the airline API respond the data will display on screen until of waiting till last API repond.\n",
      "\tThe project needed knowledge of travel APIs and GDS . First task  was created a Analysis report on travel websites ( eg: MMT , Skyscanner , Yatra , Ease my trip )that how flight result is generating and then compare it with our product including number of flights, budget of the  trip, Airlines carrier, number of routes possible , Response time  and we use postman and Json parser tool for doing this analysis.Why we are doing the analysis and what we are trying to achieve :- We are bench marking our packaging performance with other B2C APIs. We have to compare their results with our generated results. -The analysis is being done to find out avenues where we need to improve so that we are able to generate better and faster results for our end users. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tSecond task was that we have to know why we lagging in terms of reponse time, why our product is taking more time load the data. Either our API  is taking more time or API of particular airline carrier taking more time to respond the result for particular search. We noted that API of a particular airline carrier taking more time due to which all other API waiting for the result and and the response time is more on our product as compare to other.\n",
      "\tWe design a proof of work(POC) for display the result of airline API randomly instead of showing in bulk. Later UI showing the complete result in a single time and we have to wait until last airline API respond due to which user wait for long time but our task is display data parallely as the API respond It will be display on the same time, so first result on the screen will shown in shown in short time as compare previous time. \n",

      "The majority of the project shows that how to design a application with the help of flask .I was use the Unified Process in the software project. Theoretically understanding the Unified process was something that before the project I couldn’t really grasp but since completing this project I can now see the importance of each of the stages and how each is a massive contribution factor to the project as a whole. This was an excellent opportunity to get involved in meetings  and use seniors guidance to proceed into the project. It has been a lot of responsibility to produce a project like this and meet deadlines and produce a deliverable which is something that can be classes as a success. The biggest thing that I can take away from this project is with regards to the technologies used. A lot of new technologies and areas of software development have been exposed over the scope of this project especially API working process and flight booking system. This has been given me a much clearer understanding of the direction  I want to take as I start my career as a Software Engineer.  \n",
      "The project's conclusions should list the things which have been learnt as a result of the work you have done. It is common to finish the report by listing ways in which the project can be taken further.
